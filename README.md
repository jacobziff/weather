# Weather App

This is a web app that displays a weather forecast for any city. Its design is inspired by Apple's weather app.
  
This project was built using React and several other frameworks and libraries, including Tailwind CSS, Axios, and Font Awesome. For this project, I relied on Open Meteo's APIs for data and Unsplash for images.

Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Usage

Since this is a web app, all that is needed is to go to the [website](https://jacobziff.github.io/weather/). Once there, type a city name into the search bar. Do not include the region or country name, just the name of the city itself. City names that are not valid will default to my home city of Phoenix.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). More information about this can be found in [react.md](https://github.com/jacobziff/weather/blob/main/react.md).
